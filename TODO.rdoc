* Build some specs for this (horse...gate...shut...bolted)
* Some phones cannot handle GET and POST parameters in the same request.  Investigate the possibility of prepending the session_key to the path at the time the route is interpolated.

* Add a generator to build a lib containing the default check_cookie method for inclusion in to the ApplicationController.
